Hello gang!

Contest starts in 30 minutes, and just as a precursor, @d1ll0n wrote something on Twitter earlier that justifies some of the design choices in the repo which might seem on the face of it to be the work of a fistful of PCP (they were, but that's irrelevant).

We promise, there's reasoning behind it: and you might learn something new!

In preparation for the @WildcatFi V2 reviews by @alpeh_v  and @code4rena (and the inevitable criticism my code will face) I wrote something that started as a justification for my unusual code patterns and turned into a rant about ways solc is awful.

Enjoy, or don't.

[09/01/2024 08:15] 0xastronatey
Hi @functi0nZer0 @d1ll0n Is it technically possible for a Wildcat Market to temporarily run out of funds due to borrowing operations reducing reserves below the necessary level, making it unable to honor withdrawals?

[09/01/2024 10:07] functionzer0
Hi @0xAstronatey - feels like there's a couple of different sub-questions all packed in here, but the TL;DR as I'm interpreting this is that a borrow action can only take assets from the market up to the required reserves at that block

It might be the case that someone borrows *right up to the limit* in which case they go notionally delinquent in the very next block due to interest/protocol fee accrual, although that will only reflect in the market after the next non-static call that bumps the market state

It's actually quite common for people to make withdrawal requests that exceed the liquid reserves of a market, shunting everything that's currently in there into the withdrawal pool and requiring the borrower to repay assets to cover the rest of the withdrawal request plus the new required reserves limit, that's expected behaviour

You can witness this happening in V1 markets in the Wintermute USDT market [https://app.wildcat.finance/borrower/market-details/0x90d0ff1a7b1abef69eaf3952641058673439e2e3] - expand the Market History table, it happened on the 29th of August

hi5 üëç 

[09/01/2024 10:08] functionzer0
[I'm referencing a V1 market here because the core withdrawal logic works the same way in V2]


[09/01/2024 10:08] functionzer0
I'm curious to see how @Docs Wolf would answer the above, I've not seen it in action yet heh


[09/01/2024 10:12] functionzer0
The Gitbook docs includes a deeply autistic Terminology page which lays out exactly what things are composed of what [such as liquid/required reserves], that may be useful to you too


[09/01/2024 12:41] kartoonjoy
To see the @Docs Wolf in action, you'll want to pose a question in a thread.


[09/01/2024 12:41] functionzer0

I made a script to print out storage positions for the previous review when Violet had some questions about the custom storage writes. I meant to include it in the repo but forgot to, so here it is if anyone wants to avoid reading through the solc storage layout docs.

Before using, make sure foundry.toml has `extra_output=["storageLayout"]` and recompile the contracts

To use, put this in `scripts/print_storage_positions.ts` and run with
```bash
ts-node scripts/print_storage_positions.ts --contract <contract_path> --struct <struct name>
```
if you don't put any args it'll print the layout for `MarketState` by default

tbh the state of vscode extensions for solidity is kind of a mess, at least on my machine. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've found it works best when opening the repo in an isolated vs-code window that has never had any other open workspaces. I use Solidity Visual Developer by tintinweb

It seems the controllers are deprecated from V1, but WildcatArchController still has function related to controllers, why?


[09/04/2024 19:18] functionzer0
Wildcat V2 is deployed under the same archcontroller as V1: when we built V1 we intended it to be a hydra-like protocol where new market functionalities can be deployed through registering new controllers with the market initcode contained through market factories

We're moving away from that model and putting the controller functionality into hooks, but the archcontroller deployment remains the same


[09/04/2024 19:19] functionzer0
We'll be deprecating the V1 controller after V2 launch, so Wintermute can maintain their V1 markets but won't be able to deploy any new ones - to that end the controller functionality will just be dead air in the archcontroller


[09/04/2024 19:21] functionzer0
We could just redeploy an archcontroller without it but then two distinct instances of the protocol exist on-chain

I had to add this to seaport and wildcat because in both cases the solc function specializer would make the contracts oversized by several kb for a total savings of like 9 gas per transaction. It duplicates large internal functions doing external calls and such just to inline a constant and remove a few stack instructions üò≠

What happens if borrower extends the time or does not pay the amount?? I read the docs but unable to understand this


[09/08/2024 11:50] functionzer0
Borrowers can‚Äôt extend the time of the grace period or withdrawal cycle once a market is deployed, and if they just don‚Äôt repay, the penalty APR kicks in after a state bump when grace tracker hits zero

As to what happens after that, that‚Äôs more of an off-chain/legal mechanism: there isn‚Äôt a stage at which the market ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù or anything, the penalty APR will just apply in perpetuity


[09/08/2024 11:50] functionzer0
Off-chain agreements would specify how long that‚Äôd have to be in place before the market is considered legally defaulted upon, but that‚Äôs not an issue at hand in this review


[09/08/2024 11:52] functionzer0
Docs Wolf made a blooper there by saying that time can be extended, that‚Äôs not something that can be done

Hello, in the 2024-08-wildcat.md it is stated that the provider itself defines whether it is a pull provider or not. 

How will they do this? thanks.


[09/15/2024 20:34] functionzer0
Okay so a pull provider is one that the hook contract can query with nothing but an address to see if that address has a credential, whereas a push provider is one where the provider has to shunt the update themselves

In practice all providers are likely to be pull providers except for providers that correspond to a whitelisting function where some authorised EOA goes ‚Äúokay this address is cool, give it a credential‚Äù

The Gitbook (and repo in /docs) has a page ‚ÄúAccess Control Hooks‚Äù that goes into this in some depth


[09/15/2024 20:35] functionzer0
Push can use `grantRole` whereas pull can use `isPullProvider` to determine if `getCredential` is supported

Thank you so much to everyone that participated! We‚Äôve mitigated everything, added a few small changes and had another review from alpeh_v, so we‚Äôre pretty much locked down on the codebase side now!

hi @KlustDev the report was evaluated by the validator who assessed that it did not provide sufficient proof of the exploit. I agree with that, as it missed an explanation of where the bug is and what is a reasonable fix.

A coded PoC like yours is a good support tool but does not replace a proper explanation of the vulnerability. 

Worth adding: don't deploy your PoCs on public networks and/or public GitHub repos which are publicly available - this will most likely harm the protocol and will make your finding ineligible for payout; if you need to attach files that don't fit the submission through the C4 website, only **private** Gists in GitHub are allowed

Oh shoots well fair enough I'm still new to all of this and just wanted to be sure I wasn't just putting absolutely rubbish out there

no worries, welcome then! If you want, have a look [here](https://code4rena.com/audits#completed-audits) for past audit reports, you will get a good idea of what is the kind of explanation that is normally given in reports

hi i am looking at the github repo of all the findings but it says all the findings are by "howlbot-integration", how can i see the reports i made? i tried to filter by author but that does not work since all the reports are authored to "howlbot-integration"

It may help to find your submissions via the data folders. You can view them [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat-findings/tree/main/data) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat-validation/tree/main/data).

all of my issues were closed as "insufficient quality report", but i do not understand why? Some have coded PoCs and some have a walkthrough of PoCs and they all quote the vulnerable lines of code in the codebase. They all have a description of the vuln and the impacts and fixes. I would understand if the vulns weren't correct, but all of them being labeled as "insufficient quality report", I don't really understand. There isn't any comments or anything, they are just labeled "insufficient quality report". Can anyone help me understand what i did wrong in my reports? My reports can be found at "https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat-validation/tree/main/data" under Squilliam.


[10/24/2024 19:10] squilliamx
I could link to each vuln if thats makes it easier. I just want to understand what i did wrong so i don't make the same mistakes next time. I thought the reports were written well.. :/. Can someone help me please?


[10/24/2024 20:09] .boy2000
Yeah I also submitted an issue, which I thought was explained well enough, and got rejected during validation. It seems shorter issues are frowned upon, should I use AI to inflate the word count?

I know this is not the most critical issue, but current project behavior would have been unexpected/unfair if I were the borrower.

If sponsor disputed (their project their rules, whatever) it would have been ok. Just for funzies, @functi0nZer0 can you please comment at validation-80? Thank you!

Hello, I realised that Wildcat will be rewarding USDC on Polygon. The address I provided accepts only the bridged USDC. Do I need to change my address?


[11/04/2024 14:31] infectedfuture
payment already distributed, you might want to check directly with staff ü§î 
is it an exchange address ?


[11/04/2024 15:30] joseph__hpesoj
no idea. Its a trust wallet address.
how do I contact staff?


[11/04/2024 15:32] infectedfuture
to contact staff just go to #‚ùì„Éªquestions and tag one of them
oh okay, so its a self custody wallet, good thing


[11/04/2024 15:32] infectedfuture
there is no such things as address specific to a token on the EVM if its on-chain


[11/04/2024 15:33] infectedfuture
so you should have received your paiement, maybe you cannot see it because the token address isn't added to your wallet, but no reason you cannot access it


[11/04/2024 15:35] infectedfuture
if you don't see it, add the Polygon USDC address (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3c499c542cef5e3811e1192ce70d8cc03d5c3359) following this tutorial from Trust wallet: https://trustwallet.com/blog/how-to-add-a-custom-token-using-trust-wallet


[11/04/2024 15:42] joseph__hpesoj
True. Just has to toggle USDC for Polygon on in my assets tab. Got it. Bless.
